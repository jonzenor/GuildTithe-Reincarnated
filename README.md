An addon for World of Warcraft.

This is a resurrection of the GuildTithe addon that stopped working after Shadowlands due to API changes introduced in 10.0 (Dragonflight). Version 2.6 addresses these changes.

A tithe (derived from the Old English word for "tenth") is the practice of giving ten percent of something (often money) to a religious organisation or government.

GuildTithe allows you to configure how much you wish to donate to your guild bank and from what sources:
Â 
- quest rewards
- looted money
- merchants
- mail
- trade

Each slider can be set from 1% to 100%, and each category is turned off by default.

The deposit of accumulated tithe will take place shortly after the guild bank window is opened.
